## Welcome to mt32.net!

### Content

Have you ever had a computer related problem twice? The goal of this website is to
create writeups for every of these tricky problems related to programming, hacking (with hardware),
software in general and every other tech topic. Even if there is no one else with the same problem,
we will not have to struggle twice!

There will be also other content realted to personel projects with a focus on web dev and maybe game dev too.

### This Website

I plan to make this theme, and the whole website open source like most of my projects!

This blog is run by [mtorials](https://mtorials.de/), [universum](http://universegame.de/)
and hopefully occasional guest writers! We are two hobby programmers with some experience in web technologies and game development as well as embedded devices namly Arduinos and ESPs. Doing it as a hobby we both do not have extensive knowledge in any of these fields, but we think even our experience is worth sharing!
