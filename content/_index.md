# Welcome to mt32.net!

Have you ever had a computer related problem twice? The goal of this website is to
create writeups for every of these tricky problems related to programming, hacking (with hardware),
software in general and every other tech topic. Even if there is no one else with the same problem,
we will not have to struggle twice!

There will be also other content related to personal projects with a focus on web dev and maybe game dev too.

This blog is run by [mtorials](https://mtorials.de/) and [Tom aka. universum](http://universegame.de/) with occasional guest writers!
