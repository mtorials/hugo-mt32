# Virtualbox

Hi and welcome back to my new article, 
In this article I would like to tell you about the virtualization software of Oracle Virtualbox. 
I will deal with the issues, what it can do and how to install it.

# Why I use the Oracle Virtualbox?

I use the virtualbox to easily install virtual machines running Linux on my Windows PC. 
When I no longer need them I can simply delete them again. 
Oracle Virtualbox is the most popular and in my opinion the best virtualization software for Windows, Mac OS, Linux and Oracle Solaris. 
The virtual machine offers a large number of operating systems.
Currently I use the virtualbox for testing with the automation platform ansible. 
If you want to know how to install ansible please read [this](https://mt32.net/posts/ansible-install/) article.
